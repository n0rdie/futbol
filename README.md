## Project Planning:
### 1. Plan for check-ins throughout the duration of the project:
* We will meet again on Thursday and Sunday.
- We will have daily Slack communication.
- Daily check-ins during class time

### 2. Plan for project organization and workflow.
- [Project Management Tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v6x85L1qvHk5-tpt0FHqZrO9v1LS5NdLgFO1EKb3h8s/edit#gid=95404790)
- We will make sure to write the excel sheet first, followed by the test methods, followed by the code, followed by merging.
- If we follow this process, our code should not impact/block each other's code because we'll be all on the same page without having to directly compare non-spec code.
- Co-author commiting (note: we later decided against doing this after our first check-in with Kat)

### 3. Project Organization Approach:
- Meg proposed a format in excel that the team liked.
- Filling in the Excel before working on code will prevent overlap.
- No one had experience with the alternative project management tools that were suggested in iteration 1.
- Decided to go with Excel for ease of use, quick setup (no configuration required), full flexibility, and ability to view the status of everything on one page.

### 4. Code Design Approach:
- Red -> Green -> Refractor (test then code then improve)
- Start with main class and then branch and refactor as appropriate
- Use the excel sheet to track overall code design, with variables and methods documented in each class. Start with what we know and update as we go.

### 1. Top 3 things that went well during your project
- Despite initial difficult team dynamics, we were able to pull it together and work more closely as a team in the end. This required compromise, patience, and understanding from everyone on the team.
- Documentation of next steps, team goals, decisions, deadlines, meeting recaps, etc. were helpful in keeping the team aligned and in agreement. Posting these to slack allowed us to keep a record of everything internally.
- We did a great job of communicating scheduling constraints and coordinating around each other's schedules. Our team is located in 3 different time zones, so we proactively communicated about this, which allowed it to flow seamlessly.

### 2. Top 3 things your team would do differently next time
- Implement a code review process earlier on and have clearer chunks of functionality for PRs.
- Send calendar invites in advance with scheduled meeting times to ensure we're all on the same page for when we're meeting (especially with being in different time zones).
- At the beginning we could have gotten a stronger base of code before breaking out individually. It was more difficult to align after we had already taken different directions.
- Also, using TDD more effectively and in pairs would have reduced misunderstandings.
